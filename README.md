# Gym Membership Management System Using SQL and Python


## Introduction
This project involves the creation of a Gym Membership Management System that efficiently manages members, trainers, classes, and attendance. The system was designed to streamline gym operations, improve resource allocation, and provide insightful reports on gym usage.

## Problem Statement
The primary goal was to design a database that would manage the registration, attendance tracking, and scheduling processes of a gym while ensuring data integrity and efficient querying.

## Skills Demonstrated
Data cleaning and transformation using Python
SQL for data management and queries
Relational database modeling and normalization
Database security and indexing
Lucidchart for database schema modeling

## Data Sourcing
The raw data was sourced from Trent Athletic Center, which was transformed and loaded into SQL Server using Python scripts for further management and analysis.

## Data Transformation
The raw data was cleaned, transformed, and pre-processed using Python, ensuring that all data was formatted properly for relational database storage. Data integrity constraints were implemented during this process to ensure high-quality data.

## Relational Database Modeling and Normalization
Using Lucidchart, the database schema was modeled and normalized to third normal form (3NF) to eliminate data redundancy and ensure efficient querying. The schema included tables for members, trainers, classes, schedules, and attendance, all linked with appropriate foreign keys. The design adhered to principles of referential integrity and functional dependencies.

## Conclusion and Recommendation
The Gym Membership Management System effectively addresses the core needs of gym operations. The project demonstrates robust database design, high data integrity, and ease of querying. Future work could explore integrating a user interface to enhance user interaction with the database.
